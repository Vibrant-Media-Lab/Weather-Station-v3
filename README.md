# Weather-Station-v3
Arduino project by Emmanuelle Brent and Clayton Sakalousky, building upon previous VML Weather Station projects. 


### Weather data
The sensors used in this project can track a variety of data, the following measurements are used in this project: 

* **Temperature** in Celsius
* **Pressure** in Pa
* **Humidity** in percentage
* **Particulate Matter (PM) 2.5** in micrograms per cubic meter
* **Particulate Matter (PM) 10** in micrograms per cubic meter
* **Air Quality Index (AQI)**
* **AQI Level** 
* **Wind speed** in miles per hour
* **Wind heading**
* **Rain fall** in inches per hour
* **Fire safety rating**

### Components

* Arduino Ethernet Shield
* Adafruit Si7021 Temperature and HUmidity Sensor Breakout Board
* Adafruit BMP280 I2C or SPI Barometric Pressure & Altitude Sensor - STEMMA QT
* PM2.5 Air Quality Sensor and Breadboard Adapter Kit - PMS5003
